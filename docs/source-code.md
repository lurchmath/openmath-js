# Source Code

## Reading the source

The code in the repository resides in [one file](../openmath.litcoffee),
written in [Literate CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#literate).

## Changing the source

If you don't like that language, you can always compile it directly to
JavaScript with the following command.

```
coffee --compile openmath.litcoffee
```

This assumes that you've [installed
CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation) and have the [source
file](https://github.com/lurchmath/openmath-js/blob/master/openmath.litcoffee)
accessible.

## Importing the source

To import the source into your project, you can include it directly from
GitHub (using [RawGit](http://rawgit.com)) at [this
URL](https://cdn.rawgit.com/lurchmath/openmath-js/179286e3/openmath.js).
There is a source map file in the same folder; see
[here](https://github.com/lurchmath/openmath-js/blob/master/README.md).
