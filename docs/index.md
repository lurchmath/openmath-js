## Get started now

To import this code via a CDN or `npm`, check out the [API Reference
Page](api-reference.md).

## Background

[OpenMath](http://www.openmath.org) is a data storage standard for
meaningful mathematics.  Rather than encoding the appearance of the
mathematics (like [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) does, for
instance), it encodes the meaning of the mathematics (similar to [Content
MathML](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter4.html#contm.intro)).  You can
read its latest standard
[here](http://www.openmath.org/standard/om20-2004-06-30/).
